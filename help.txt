Usage: thintest [pattern1, pattern2 ...]

Where patterns are optional paths to the test files to be run.
The paths should be relative to --testDir and can be micromatch glob expressions
(see https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features).
If omitted, all JS files under --testDir are run.

Options:

--root:             Path containing your package.json.
                    Used as base for other relative paths.
                    Defaults to the location of the nearest package.json wrt. cwd.

--testDir:          Path containing your test files (default: "test").

--srcDir:           Path containing your source files (default: "src").

--failFast, -f:     Skip further tests as soon as possible after a failed test.

--progressSize:     Number of characters to use for the progress bar (default: 40).

--assert:           Module ID of assert package to use (default: standard Node assert)

--stackLimit:       Limit the number of stack frames to print for failed tests (default: 5)

--maxConcur, -c:    Limit the number of tests to run simultaneously (default: 10).
                    This is especially relevant with --failFast, as the more tests are running,
                    the longer it'll take to stop after the first failure.

--expandAll, -a:    Also include details about successful and skipped tests in the output.

--verbose, -v:      Print more info (such as normalized options).

--help, -h:         You're reading it.

These options can also be defined in your package.json, like so:

    "thintest": {
        "srcDir": "src/main",
        "testDir": "src/test"
    }

In fact, any options given via the command line will be merged with and override those from your package.json.

The process exits with code 0 when all tests were successful, with 1 when there were any failures
and with 2 if there was an error outside of a test.
